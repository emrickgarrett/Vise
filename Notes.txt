// These are Just personal notes that I will want to remember later

/*
* Wrap around needs to be implemented, I forgot initially
* Create "helper" classes to get different coordinates, instead of copying code constantly
* Look into math based on y as x axis, x as y axis, for a simpler method (normal hex board)
* Add sound, and Game menu with Options/start/exit; Pause menu; Sounds; and a Victory Screen
* Track Progression across multiple games
